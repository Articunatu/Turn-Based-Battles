# Turn Based Battles
 
## Gameplay
Inspired by the turn-based battle systems from popular RPGs: 1vs1 battles between two characters, each character has access to at most 4 attacks, defeat all your opponents characters to win. Before going into a battle you decide which characters should be in your team, then set the attacks and attribute values each of them.
In comparison to the games that inspired this one, there are no elements of randomness in this battle system; they key to win lies solely in preparation and psychology.
